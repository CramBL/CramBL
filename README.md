### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Marc

I like working on open-source software, especially in Rust, as Rust projects are very standardized and therefore easy to get started with ðŸ˜ƒ

### Currently contributing code to

- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- [ublox](https://github.com/ublox-rs/ublox)

... but I also help with issues and bug reports in various other projects.

### My projects

The most production-ready projects with the **broadest usability** are probably:

- [Fidelity Fetch](https://github.com/CramBL/fidelityfetch) - Portable high-performance HTTP server that acts as a file browser, with DNS-SD capabilities.
- [MDNS Scanner](https://github.com/CramBL/mdns-scanner) - Portable TUI for scanning a network and mapping IPs to (m)DNS hostnames

Potentially interesting projects:

- [fastPASTA](https://github.com/CramBL/fastPASTA) - CLI for debugging the [CERN ALICE detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALICE_experiment)
- [Plotinator3000](https://github.com/luftkode/plotinator3000) - High-performance Cross-platform native (+WASM) GUI for viewing logs from our sensor array at [SkyTEM](https://skytem.com/)

### On the educational side

I have [Rust performance comparison](https://github.com/CramBL/rust-perf-comp) & [Rust Assembly comparison](https://github.com/CramBL/rust-asm-comp) that help shine a light on the low-level result of certain Rust language constructs.
