Outside of my job I'm working on an app for managing an [MTGO](https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo) collection. It's a massive task, and if you're interested in my approach and are proficient in Go/Rust/C++ have a look at [mtgo-collection-manager](https://github.com/CramBL/mtgo-collection-manager/) I'd love to collaborate.
