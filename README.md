### Hi 👋, I'm Marc

I like working on open-source software, especially in Rust, as Rust projects are very standardized and therefore easy to get started with 😃

### Currently contributing code to

- [ublox](https://github.com/ublox-rs/ublox)
- [hdf5](https://github.com/metno/hdf5-rust)

... but I also help with issues and bug reports in various other projects.

### My projects

The most production-ready projects with the **broadest usability** are probably:

- [MDNS Scanner](https://github.com/CramBL/mdns-scanner) - Portable TUI for scanning a network and mapping IPs to (m)DNS hostnames
- [Fidelity Fetch](https://github.com/CramBL/fidelityfetch) - Portable high-performance HTTP server that acts as a file browser, with DNS-SD capabilities.

### On the educational side

I have [Rust performance comparison](https://github.com/CramBL/rust-perf-comp) & [Rust Assembly comparison](https://github.com/CramBL/rust-asm-comp) that help shine a light on the low-level result of certain Rust language constructs.
